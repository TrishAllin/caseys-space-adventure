This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Welcome to Casey's Space Adventure!
## Background
Back when Flash was cool (actually probably as it was just becoming uncool), I created a project called Casey's Space Adventure. Based on my son's love for outer space, I set out to create an e-book/game app to teach him about the solar system in a fun way. The program was mostly complete stylistically, but my novice skills in JavaScript prevented me from finishing the games included in the project.
## What I'm working on
This is my attempt to modernize my old Flash program with Javascript, React, Bootstrap, keeping the look and feel of the original design. 
### Goals
Casey's Space Adventure will have a loading splash to a main page of the solar system. Where you can either choose the planet you want to go to or start the adventure from the beginning. Each feature of the solar system will have a piece of continuing storyline of Casey's adventure, facts about the feature/planet, the ability to take a picture and scrapbook it or play a game. Ultimate goal, if you complete all of these for each space feature you earn a badge.

## To Use Project
1. Clone down the project
2. Make sure you have npm and node installed. (I used Homebrew)
3. ```npm install```
4. To Run: ```npm start```
5. You should see Casey's Space Adventure in your browser at localhost:3000!
